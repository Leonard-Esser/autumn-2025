**This is work in progress.**

If you want to understand the source code start with *main.py*.

## Objective
This little Python analyzes a sample of *GitHub* repositories. It obtains a Pandas DataFrame where each row is a file specific commit containing information RE the changes made to the documentation of communication channels.

This little Python is expected to help in the context of empirical research RE the communication in open-source software projects hosted on *GitHub*.

For instance, this little Python is expected to help answering the following research question:
Between X and Y – e.g., 2008 and 2024 –, in large-scale open-source software projects hosted on GitHub, how has the documentation of communication channels evolved over time?
